= Magical Language Lyrical Lisp

Let's play in Lisp!


== How to run Lyrical Lisp

Lyrical Lisp is consist of text data, graphic data, and sound data. This
repository has only source code of text data. In order to get all data,
download ``lyricallisp_free-X.X.zip'' from following URL:

  https://lyrical.zick.run/download.html

If you unzip it, ``lyricallisp_free'' directory is created. You can run Lyrical
Lisp by double-clicking the ``nsclisper.exe'' in the directory.


== How to compile your source code

In order to run Lyrical Lisp with your source code, you must make ``nscript.dat''
and put it to ``lyricallisp_free'' directory.

You can compile your source files (``X.txt'') into ``nscript.dat'' using
``nscmake.exe'' which can be downloaded from following URL:

  http://www.nscripter.com/

Or you can also make ``nscript.dat'' with following commands:

% vi a.c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int i;
  for (i = 1; i < argc; ++i) {
    char b;
    FILE* fp = fopen(argv[i], "r");
    while (fread(&b, 1, 1, fp)) {
      if (b != '\r') {
        printf("%c", b ^ 0x84);
      }
    }
    printf("%c", '\n' ^ 0x84);
    fclose(fp);
  }
  return 0;
}
% gcc -o a a.c
% ./a *.txt > nscript.dat
